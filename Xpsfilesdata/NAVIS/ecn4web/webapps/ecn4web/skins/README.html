<p>Skins are the "look" of an application. These can be found here, in
the framework, or in the specific application. For starters, we are creating
application-specific skins.</p>

<p>The header of the Html page will set the "base" of the Html document
to be within the Skin's folder. Therefore, if you skin is called "red", and
your application is named "myapp", base will be set to:</p>
<pre>
<code>
	"http://127.0.0.1:8080/myapp/skins/red/"
</code>
</pre>
<p>What this means to application designers is that when referring to skin
resources, simply use a relative path. For example, use "images/mybutton.gif".</p>
