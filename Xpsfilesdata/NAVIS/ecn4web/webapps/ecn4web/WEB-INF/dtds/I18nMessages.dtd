Note that each tag has the structure:

CATEGORY__ERROR_TYPE

'CATEGORY' is the general category of the error to help keep things organized

'ERROR_TYPE' name as long as necessary to clearly explain the error message.
This should generally be a direct transformation of the English error message,
although the English (value) may add a little more.

This file will be used by the presentation tier to build localizable resource
files and to present messages to the user.

You'll have to encode entities (less than, greater than and ampersands [avoid]),
and don't use line breaks within the messages. If you need these, bring it up
as a new requirement.


History:
Version 1.0 2004.03 AJP
Rewrote many of the framework files, so it made sense to go
ahead and add DTD validation.
The Xslts may handle a more flexible format than this, but this is the officially
sanctioned one. If you have another format, ask Andy to convert it. He has an
Xsl that will do this.

<!ELEMENT properties (message+)>

<!-- a message can have one or more "values", which is the actual localized
string. By default it is assumed to be English. In the future, we will allow
multiple languages here and use the "lang" attribute to differenciate them. -->
<!ELEMENT message (value)*>

<!-- A message must have a key. This should be formatted like a Java constant,
such as "MYAPP_MODULE_ERROR_FORGOT_TO_BUY_MILK". The naming scheme is somewhat
loose at this point. Pick a rigorous one if you would like.
 An optional "class" may be used to group messages into categories. This may
 make the localizers job easier and will make it easier to break up files later
 on into different pieces.
