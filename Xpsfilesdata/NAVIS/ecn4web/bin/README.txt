 To start Tomcat in development environment please use the script
 "dev-tomcat.bat" (Using default "startup.bat" will not work)
 
 By default "dev-tomcat.bat" will start the application in debug mode (debugger port 5005)

 If you do not want to start in debug mode, set the environment variable N4_TOMCAT_NODEBUG.
